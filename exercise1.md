The project is made with Clojure and ClojureScript. Clojure developers often use many different editors ranging from Emacs to VSCode. The linting tool, [Clj-kondo](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo), is fortunately editor and build-tool agnostic, so that can be used both when editing the code and in the build pipeline. For testing, Clojure comes with a unit testing framework, clojure.test, which is mostly enough for testing Clojure and ClojureScript projects. Clojure runs on top of the JVM, so when building Clojure apps, we usually create `.jar` files. The commonly used tool, Leiningen, is used both when creating the project and managing dependencies and building the project into a `.jar` file. For ClojureScript projects the corresponding tool is Shadow CLJS. Shadow CLJS provides dependency management and the compiler to compile the project into JavaScript. Shadow CLJS also uses JVM under the hood.

To set up CI, first we need to know where the project's git repository is hosted. GitHub is one option, but it might be in BitBucket or GitLab too, or even in a self-hosted git server. Usually, when the project is hosted online, in some of the services, the easiest choice is to set up the CI system built into the service. GitHub has Github Actions, BitBucket has BitBucket pipelines and GitLab CI/CD. In addition to these, there are platform-independent solutions like Jenkins, and tools that can be integrated into the services, like Travis and CircleCI that work with Github.

For a Clojure & ClojureScript project that makes up a fullstack application, both self-hosted and cloud environments are fine. Self-hosted CI gives full control over the OS and the build process, but takes more resources to upkeep. It is safe as no data (assuming that the git server is also self-hosted) will be uploaded to any third-party services. However, cloud-based solutions are usually easier to setup and maintain as many things are ready-made. Cloud builds also might cost more than self-hosted ones, although the cost of self-hosting is not free either. With cloud builds the performance might not be as good, or it might cost a lot to get enough resources. But for a Clojure & ClojureScript application this should not matter as they are quite lightweight and fast to build.
